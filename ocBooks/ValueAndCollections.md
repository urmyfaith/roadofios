# Value and Collections值和集合
Although Objective-C is an object-oriented programming language, it is a superset of C, which means you can use any of the standard C scalar (non-object) types like int, float and char in Objective-C code. (由于OC是C超集,也就是说你可以使用c里面的数据类型.)There are also additional scalar types available in Cocoa and Cocoa Touch applications, such as NSInteger, NSUInteger and CGFloat, which have different definitions depending on the target architecture.(在Cocoa和CocoaTouch里,也有基本的数组类型,例如NSInteger,NSUInteger,CGFloat,这些不同的数据类型和目标的结构有关.)
Scalar types are used in situations where you just don’t need the benefits (or associated overheads) of using an object to represent a value.(标量数据类型用于不需要使用对象的特性的情况下.) While strings of characters are usually represented as instances of the NSString class, numeric values are often stored in scalar local variables or properties.(字符构成的字符串通常代表一个NSString类,数值通常储存在标量局部变量或者属性之中.)
It’s possible to declare a C-style array in Objective-C, but you’ll find that collections in Cocoa and Cocoa Touch applications are usually represented using instances of classes like NSArray or NSDictionary. (在OC里有可能声明C类型的数组,但是你会发现在OC里用的大多数都是NSArray,NSDictionary.)These classes can only be used to collect Objective-C objects, which means that you’ll need to create instances of classes like NSValue, NSNumber or NSString in order to represent values before you can add them to a collection.(在把元素添加到结合中的时候,需要把元素转换位NSValue,NSNumber,NSString等对象,以便存储.)
The previous chapters in this guide make frequent use of the NSString class and its initialization and class factory methods, as well as the Objective-C @"string" literal, which offers a concise syntax to create an NSString instance. (前一章节里提供了比较简洁的方法来对,NSSting类初始化和和根据类方法创建对象 .)This chapter explains how to create NSValue and NSNumber objects, using either method calls or through Objective-C value literal syntax.(这一章解释通过方法调用,或者字面上的语法来 创建一个NSValue嗯哼NSNumber对象.)
